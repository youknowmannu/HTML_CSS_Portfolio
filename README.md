# HTML_CSS_Portfolio

Portfolio Website
This repository contains a simple portfolio website that I created using only HTML and CSS. The purpose of this project is to showcase my work, skills, and experiences in a clean and visually appealing manner.

The portfolio website is a single-page application that serves as an online resume and portfolio. It provides a brief overview of who I am, the projects I've worked on, and the skills I possess. The website's design is minimalist yet modern, focusing on presenting information effectively and providing a smooth user experience.
