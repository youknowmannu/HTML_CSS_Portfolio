# HTML_CSS_Portfolio

Portfolio Website
This repository contains a simple portfolio website that I created using only HTML and CSS. The purpose of this project is to showcase my work, skills, and experiences in a clean and visually appealing manner.

The portfolio website is a single-page application that serves as an online resume and portfolio. It provides a brief overview of who I am, the projects I've worked on, and the skills I possess. The website's design is minimalist yet modern, focusing on presenting information effectively and providing a smooth user experience.

About Me: Learn a bit about me, my background, and what drives me in my professional journey.

Portfolio: View a curated selection of my projects, each with a short description and a link to its live demo or GitHub repository.

Skills: Get an overview of the key skills I have developed and the technologies I am proficient in.

Contact: Find ways to get in touch with me for potential collaborations or inquiries.
